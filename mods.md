# Prerequisites

Make sure you installed the [core mod](https://github.com/sam-k0/LoopHeroCallbackCore) before trying to run the game with the below listed mods.

You **need** this mod installed. The other mods depend on this and not installing it will cause the other mods to not work.<br>

## Custom Sprite Replacer
Lets you change game sprites (example included)<br>
<span style="color: cyan;">⚙ supported by </span>``≥ 2.1.6``
<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
This mod allows you to replace sprites during runtime. Unlike replacing the sprites in the game files like when using [UndertaleModTool] for example, you don't need to back-up the game files before modifying them, as these don't get changed on your hard disk.
Also you can't break your game installation using this.
