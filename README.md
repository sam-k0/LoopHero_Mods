# LoopHero_Mods

This repo contains my mods for Loop Hero.

Right now, only the "Borderless Window" mod works, <br>
as YYToolkit (ver. 2.1.2 as of 2023/04/03) crashes when entering the battle room.<br>

# Installation

Download the latest release from the release tab on the right --><br>
Unzip the .zip file so the contents are in the game directory<br>
where `Loop Hero.exe` resides.<br>

### Your directory should look like this:<br>
```
├── Loop Hero.exe
├── data.win
├── dinput8.dll
├── NativeMods/
│   ├── mod dlls go here!
│   └── BorderlessHero.dll
└── *other game files*

# Controls
## Borderless Hero (Borderless window mod)
- Press F11 to make the window borderless.
Tip: To change back to bordered, press the "Windowed x2" or "Windowed x3" button

```
